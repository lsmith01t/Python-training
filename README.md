Welcome to my portfolio of python projects. 

From the analysis provided the data does not provide a good predictor for sales regardless of if you a regression model or a decision tree. 
You can see from the R2 numbers as well as comparisson on MSE and RMSE from test to training sets that a better more fine tuned model is needed. 

We do not see low bias and low variance so the model is not underfit.
